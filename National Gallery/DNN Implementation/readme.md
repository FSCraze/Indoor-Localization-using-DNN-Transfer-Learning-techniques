# DNN Implementation code (WIP) 

## Loss graphs 
- loss graphs for different optimizers & datasets 


## outputs 
- Model save states every 5 epochs after epoch 100 
  - control
  - filter
  - RFE 

## NG DNN.ipynb 
- DNN model that takes preprocessed datasets as input and generate lat/lon coordinates as output 
- Saves model state every 5 epochs 


## python files 
- to be added
