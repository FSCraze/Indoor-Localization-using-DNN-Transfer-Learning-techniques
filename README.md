## Project description
- Exploring and implementing Indoor localization using DNN techniques 


[National Gallery]
- Using collected data to experiment on DNN techniques to improve the accuracy of the indoor localization 

[UJIndoor dataset]
- Using UJIndoor dataset to test on pre-processing & DNN techniques

## Techniques explored/experimented: 
- Preprocessing
    - Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
        - implementation of RFE on National Gallery dataset in `National Gallery/Datasets/RFE/` 
    - Threshold filtering 
        - implementation of Threshold filtering on National Gallery dataset in `National Gallery/Datasets/filter/` 

- DNN (WIP)
    - DNN implementation codes are defined in `National Gallery/DNN Implementation/` 
    - Tested with both unprocessed and processed datasets
